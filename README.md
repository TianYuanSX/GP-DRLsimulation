# GP-DRLsimulation-SFJSS
The unitilisation of GP on DRL simulation. Detailed information on the [simulation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9826438). 

Just so you know, there is a bug when the operations system is Windows. Everything will be fine on Linux. 

This bug will be fixed as soon as possible. I'm so sorry about that!
