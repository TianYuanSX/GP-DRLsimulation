# GP-DRLsimulation-SFJSS
The unitilisation of GP on DRL simulation. Detailed information on the [simulation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9826438). 

Just so you know, the running speed of Python is very slow. If you want to accelerate the speed, use the "multiprocessing" package, located in Line 154 in junwei/utils/init.py.

NOTE that when using the "multiprocessing" package, there is a bug when the operations system is Windows. Everything will be fine on Linux. 

This bug will be fixed as soon as possible. I'm so sorry about that!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by email.
